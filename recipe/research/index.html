        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Make the cake:</strong> Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees. Generously grease three 8-inch baking pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.</li>
          <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle or in a large bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir until well combined and no lumps remain.</li>
          <li>In a large measuring cup, whisk together the oil, sour cream, eggs and vanilla; pour the mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Mix on low until the dry ingredients are moistened, then increase the speed to medium-high and mix for 2 minutes, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl halfway through. Carefully fold the coffee into the batter using a flexible spatula.</li>
          <li>Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans (about 2 cups/530 grams per pan) and tap them on the counter a few times to release any large air bubbles. Bake until puffed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Set the pans on a wire rack and let the cakes cool for about 20 minutes. Then, run a thin knife around the edges of the pan and carefully turn the cakes out onto the rack to cool completely. (You may have to tap the pans gently on the rack to release each cake.)</li>
          <li><strong>Make the ganache:</strong> When the cakes are nearly cool, add the chocolate, vanilla extract and salt to a heat-safe bowl. Bring the heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Pour the hot cream into the bowl with the chocolate and let sit for 2 minutes. Whisk the mixture until smooth, then refrigerate for about 30 minutes, whisking occasionally, until it is a thick, fudgy, spreadable texture.</li>
          <li><strong>Assemble the cake:</strong> Trim the tops of the cakes flat if necessary. Just before frosting the cake, whisk the ganache until smooth, making sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as the ganache will be more firm around the edges.</li>
          <li>Place one layer of cake on a serving plate, trimmed side up. Spread about ½ cup of the ganache evenly over the top of the cake, pushing a little bit more of the ganache toward the edge of the cake to make a small dam to hold the jam. Spoon 3 tablespoons of raspberry jam over the ganache and carefully spread it to the edge of the ganache dam. Take about 1 cup of the raspberries and press them into the ganache and jam in a single layer. If the berries are particularly large, gently tear them in half so they lay flat.</li>
          <li>Place the second layer of cake on top of the ganache, trimmed side down, and press gently. Once again, spread with ½ cup ganache and 3 tablespoons jam, and top with 1 cup raspberries.</li>
          <li>Place the remaining cake layer on top, trimmed side down, and press gently to adhere. (If the cake seems loose or wobbly, refrigerate it briefly before proceeding.)</li>
          <li>Spread a thin layer of ganache (about 1 cup) over the top and sides of the cake. (Be careful not to transfer crumbs back into the bowl of ganache.) Refrigerate the cake just until the ganache layer is firm, about 15 minutes. Keep the remaining ganache at room temperature (see Tip).</li>
          <li>Spread the remaining ganache (about 1 scant cup) over the top and sides of the cake. (The cooler temperature of the cake will cause the ganache to solidify, so work quickly.) Decorate the top of the cake with fresh raspberries. Serve at room temperature, using a hot, clean and dry knife for the tidiest slices. (Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p class="tip">
          If the ganache hardens before you use all of it, set the bowl over a pan of simmering water and stir occasionally
          until the ganache is thick and smooth. If your ganache loses its sheen, gently go over the outside of the cake with
          a kitchen torch or a hairdryer on a low setting.
